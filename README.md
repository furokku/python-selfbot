# python-selfbot

python selfbot that will spam your message whereever you type `start.spam` while bot is active

# how to use
1. download .py file, make sure you have discord.py installed with pip
2. open python file, insert token at end of file at `TOKEN = 'paste-here'`, replacing paste-here with your token. optionally you can use a .env
3. replace `your message here` in line 10 with, well, your message

disclaimer: i am not responsible if you get tos'd on discord, this was a simple project when i wanted to mess around with the discord.py library, and i am not to be blamed for issues as i do not use this script personally.
